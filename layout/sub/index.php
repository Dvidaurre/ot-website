	<h1>Welcome to Perfect Tibia </h1>
	<h4> We realized that long ago, Tibia made continuous wrong decisions. Cipsoft failed to improve the gameplay, and made tibia easy and less meaningful with every update they released</h4>
	<h4> However not everything was terrible, some sprites, spells, mechanics and quests were valuable. We realized that despite the fact Cipsoft "ruined " the game we used to love, they also made some valuable improvements in terms of graphics and content
	</h4>
	<h4> We believe that Tibia's best moment was between versions 8.0 and 8.1, we believe that some sweet spot between the old gameplay and some of the new features that were added to the game will create an awesome experience</h4>
	<h4>We decided to create what we believe is the perfect version of Tibia.</h4>
